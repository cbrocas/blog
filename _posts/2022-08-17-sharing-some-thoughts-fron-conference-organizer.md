2022 has been quite a crucial year in the [Pass the SALT](https://www.pass-the-salt-org/) conference short history. We had to switch back to an in person form of event. 

It can seem quite obvious, but after two years of full remote conference, it has been quite challenging. 

As often said, **#SharingIsCaring**!

So, in this blogpost, I will share: 

- **some doubts** I have crossed during the restart of the conference 
- **some thoughts about conference organization** after 15 years of involvement as a [volunteer conference founder and organiser](https://www.brocas.org/#about). 

# Being back on stage after 2 years long pandemic

When you have organized an event once a year for more than 10 years and suddenly, pandemic stops you and your friends during more than 2 years, **it impacts you**. No more physical contact nor social interaction whereas a conference is essentially a face-to-face event. Even if you don't see or admit it, it hurts you as a social person!

After that, the relaunch of the event hasn't be a easy path. One month before the #PTS22 event, I have even decided to resign just after the [2022 edition](https://2022.pass-the-salt.org/). I have shared it with [@doegox](https://twitter.com/doegox) and [@\_cryptocorn\_](https://twitter.com/_cryptocorn_).

**Why resigning?**

I didn't see the point of investing time and energy in events like Pass the SALT anymore.

I doubted my own added value. I also doubted the impact that this type of event could have on the security ecosystem, on the speakers and on the attendees.

I have been quite frustated all along the process of restarting the event under its in person form:
- **less attendees** have registered and finally came ,
- we had to deal with constraints due to the pandemic (ex.: how to find a "safe" location for the social event?). 
- **less speakers were also eager to physically attend the conference**. I definitively understand their point of view. But it has been very frustrating on my side because meeting new speakers, make interactions happen between them and other speakers or attendees is at the core of the event.

Failing to provoke desire into some potential speakers heart has been really hard to live during this fragile moment of relaunching the event. **I wasn't sure anymore to have the words and the vision to lead this conference** and convince people to participate. 

Finally, [@doegox](https://twitter.com/doegox) convinced me to postpone my announcement after the event. Social interactions during the event have generated enough energy to do the magic! For the moment at least ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

And now, some thoughts about organizing conferences!

For the record, my experience as a conference organizer comes from:
- RMLL Security track curator role from 2008 to 2017
- and Pass the SALT founder and organizer since 2018.

# One more conference, really?

Despite a small adjustement after the pandemic period and some conferences stop, we can say that IT or Security conferences are just everywhere nowadays. 

From local events run by volunteers to huge commercial events in the middle of the desert. Specialized on a particular topic or covering all the modern Security landscape. Not being able to find the right one for you is quite difficult, aside the location and the cost.

I think that **your main challenge** before launching a new conference is to **find a brand new angle**, not already covered by another conference, at least in your area.

Of course, you can run an event locally without any specific topic/angle aside Security. A lot of BSides events are like that. Your event will provide to the local community the opportunity to encounter seasoned speakers and do social networking. It will have an impact, no problem wih that.

# Your mission, both a tool and a responsibility

But, not having a specific focus or mission will be a lack on the long term. The event will have a harder time providing a clear vision of what it will have brought to the community.

**Having a specific mission provides you your identity**. 

First, having your own mission is a big part of your attractivity. For potential speakers, for attendees, for the community.

Then, if you respect your mission at each step of your decision process, your mission becomes an effective tool to maintain consistency over the long term. 

**Being consistent over time with your mission helps you build credibility for your event** and allows you to build trust with participants and the broader security community.

# Apology of long term actions

After speaking about your identity, let's give a look to the footprint you might leave into the community history.

My preferred way to think and act is to do things on the long time scale. Because it forces you to be humble and to build things in a solid way (try to).

Acting on the long term have some positive impacts on conference organizing:
- **organizers less suffer from the instantaneous results quest** that modern world is asking them for ,
- organizers are pushed to **adopt an iterative rythm** 
- **these iterations secure the foundation** upon your event is built on and grows.

To illustrate, Pass the SALT is dedicated to Free Software and Security. 

The values that underpin the event are:
- **transparency**,
- **freedom of access** 
- and **collaboration** between individuals.

In our case, being part of the long term and act in line with our mission therefore translates into multiple choices:
- set up **an event whose access is free of charge** for all (talks, workshops, pauses and social event included);<br> ‚û°Ô∏è done **since 2008** ;
- adding **each year** to a [self hosted archive site](https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/) all the **slides and videos** produced during the current edition ; <br> ‚û°Ô∏è done **since 2008** ;
- [document into the open all collaborations](https://www.pass-the-salt.org/achievements/#contributions) resulting from the conference. <br> ‚û°Ô∏è done **since 2011**.

# Standing on the shoulders of giants

But long term actions came also from our history.

Our roots mainly come from the [Libre Software Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_Software_Meeting) (or Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre / RMLL in French). 

Apart from RMLL, Philippe has been part of the <a href="https://www.brucon.org/">BruCon</a> for years or helped at <a href="https://www.hack.lu/">Hack.lu</a>. On his side, Mathieu has been a member of the <a href="https://www.sstic.org">SSTIC</a> org team for a long time.

We have all being part of the RMLL organization, mainly as Security track curators.  We have learned a lot from this organization team, from the achievements and maybe even more from the fails!

For example, we learned that changing almost all the organization team as done each year by RMLL since 2003 is a sure win for loosing expertise and deep understanding of how an event works. 

So, since we founded Pass the SALT, we paid a special attention to:
- **the management of our small team**, 
- **document the functioning of the conference** for new members or simply to be able to capitalize a little more year after year.

Being part of a bigger event than our small track also helped us **to safely learn the job and try some ideas**: setting up an English only spoken track, see the benefits of having a speakers dinner etc.

**Hats off to the creators of RMLL** and core team members from 2008 to 2017! Learned a lot and Pass the SALT wouldn't be there without you üëè

**Special attention:** this year, we have the surprise to see one of RMLL colleagues, [Georges Khaznadar](https://2019.educode.be/intervenants/georges-khaznadar/), former Education track co curator, to be in the room at #PTS22. A very emotional moment for me and I am really sad not having been able to share a longer moment with you, Georges! I hope during a next edition ‚ù§Ô∏èü§û

# A little extra soul

As a small event, we can not rely on the fact we would be a must-attend event. We have to prove that this event is a little special and deserves to visit it!

We created our conference with a special care to the details and as users of our own work.

For example, we try to:
- **make access to the conference as easy as possible** for both attendees and speakers (no cost entry, no personal information collection, straight forward registration process or detailed information on website and pushed to particpants mailbox) ;
- even if it is a zero cost event, **set up paid pauses and social event** to maximize exchange times ;
- put a special attention to the **(always documented!) badge design production** ;
- provide a <a href="https://2022.pass-the-salt.org/report/">yearly report</a> with all the figures and the detailed feedback received from speakers and attendees.

We also always **try to go to people, speak with a lot of present people, putting as much affect as we can** into these exchanges!

This last part is quite important for me. We all organize this event to encounter people, new ones and old friends. For my part, without meetings, I would just quit the boat, as simple as that.

One of our attendees, past speaker and seasonned conference organizer qualifies us as an event with _"a little extra soul‚Äù_ ü§© 

Thanks a lot [@tomchop_](https://twitter.com/tomchop_), we will try not to disappoint you in the future üòò

# Summer

Due to our history (RMLL we are looking at you!), our conference has always been held during the first days of July.

I use to run the conference organization with my friends and then, I usually disappear (almost) for 2 or 3 weeks somewhere right after.

It is a way to come down softly after the rush of emotions generated by the conference and its participants. 

If you have participated to that kind of events as an organizer or even an attendee, it may be like going to an intense festival. It takes time to digest all the emotions and ideas you have felt or crossed during these few days.

**This after-event period is a very profitable moment for me to try to transform all these emotions and ideas into new directions for the next iteration of the conference.**

**Summer is also the period of Music, Photography  festivals**. I always try to participate to these kind of events. I try also to find and read interviews of festival organizers. For example, give a try to this <a href="https://www.fisheyemagazine.fr/rdv/cest-dans-le-mag/nous-mettons-les-artistes-en-orbite-arles-est-une-vraie-rampe-de-lancement/">Sam Stourdz√© interview</a> [fr], former Rencontres d'Arles director (main FR ). It is such a rich source of inspiration despite the differences between the events.

**All of this also provides you a lot of new perspectives and ideas you can try to adapt to your own event to improve it** üôÇ.

I finally came to the end of this quite (too?) long article. I hope you enjoy the ride and of course, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/cbrocas">come back to me</a> to exchange about these topics.
